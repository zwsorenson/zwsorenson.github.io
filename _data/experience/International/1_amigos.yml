      testimonial:
          text: What impresses me the most about Zach is his demeanor and the way he interacts with others, whether they be high school students or adults. He always has a sparkle in his eye and is quick to smile or find humor in almost any situation. When faced with difficulties or last-minute changes, Zach is unfazed â€” he just rolls up his sleeves and moves on with the task at hand. His can-do work ethic, persistence, affable personality, and even-handed approach with people served him well as one of our Chapter leaders.
