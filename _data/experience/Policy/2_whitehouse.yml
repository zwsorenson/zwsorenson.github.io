      testimonial:
          text: During his time with our team, Mr. Sorenson exhibited a calmness under tremendous pressure, a thoughtful and critical eye for content hierarchy, policy communications, technology, and design, making him an invaluable asset. Performing above and beyond the average intern, Mr. Sorenson was given more responsibility, room for exploration and discovery than others. Sometimes we found it difficult to remember that he was still a student rather than someone with a great deal more professional life experience.
