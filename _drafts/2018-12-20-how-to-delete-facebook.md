The company itself has been consistently deceptive in its collection of user data and behaved irresponsibly when misuse has been uncovered. All of that aside, though, the main reason I haven't deleted my account is because I still find it useful (probably not useful enough to [pay $1000/year for](), but useful nonetheless).
