title: How to delete Facebook without deleting Facebook

I've become increasingly convinced that Facebook is bad. It's bad for teenagers' mental health. Bad for productivity. Bad for news and media and information consumption. Probably bad for democracy. The company itself has been consistently deceptive in its collection of user data and behaved irresponsibly when misuse has been uncovered.

All of that aside, though, the main reason I haven't deleted my account is because I still find it useful—probably not useful enough to [pay $1000/year for](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0207101), but useful nonetheless.

I like using Facebook for events. It's helpful to have a list of friends and acquaintances that I don't necessarily have saved in my phone contacts—especially when I want to double-check someone's birthday. So instead of completely deleting my account, I've done a few hacky things to drastically cut back on the Facebook UI. Since several people have asked me how to do the same thing, I thought I'd post some brief instructions.


## Step 1: Kill the News Feed
Facebook itself [admits](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-is-spending-time-on-social-media-bad-for-us/) that "when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information [on social media] — reading but not interacting with people — they report feeling worse afterward." On the other hand, they argue, "actively interacting with people — especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions — is linked to improvements in well-being." 

The problem is that passive consumption on Facebook happens in the News Feed. This is where Facebook makes its money, so it's not going anywhere any time soon.

The solution? Block it. This means two things:

1. Delete the app on your phone.
2. Use a browser extension to block the News Feed's `<div>`. I use [uBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) on Firefox.


## Step 3: Notifications


## Step 4: Privacy


## Problems this solution doesn't fix
