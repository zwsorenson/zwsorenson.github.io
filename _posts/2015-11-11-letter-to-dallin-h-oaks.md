Dear Elder Oaks,

You probably don’t remember me, but we met when you visited Oakland last
February. At my father’s suggestion, I had driven up from school that Sunday
morning to hear your remarks.

There was no way you could have known this at the time, but I had spent
a lot of the previous few weeks wrestling with my sexuality. I had not
yet told anyone that I was gay, but had come to at least personally
accept that part of my identity. The weekend you and I both came to
Oakland was the first time I had come home since reaching this
understanding.

When I finally came out to my family a few months later, the response
was warm, loving, and accepting — although I know many Mormon teens are
not so fortunate. My dad, a former bishop of our local congregation and
a member of the Oakland Stake Presidency, sent me a long and thoughtful
letter, in which he shared a story you recounted during your meeting
with him and other Church leaders in Oakland:

> I was not around when Blacks received the priesthood, but I was moved
> by Elder Oaks’ comments about this period. He had concluded Church
> doctrine was incorrect on this subject and there needed to be a
> change... So, when President Kimball called Dallin Oaks, then
> President of BYU, to tell him that he and the Apostles had finally
> received revelation to ordain all worthy males to the priesthood,
> Elder Oaks said he went out and wept and wept.
>
> Zach — perhaps you can’t see it now, but the Church has moved on this
> topic [LGBT issues] at a blistering pace, and Elder Oaks assured us
> the First Presidency considers the topic daily in their meetings. In
> our local village, we move just a pace ahead.

This story and others like it gave people like my dad hope that the
Church, albeit slowly and haphazardly, was moving towards a position of
fuller understanding and acceptance of LGBT people. But the Church’s new
policies on gay people and their families show that this is not the case
— at least not yet.

Under the new policy, if I stay in the Church and marry someone I love,
I will be considered an apostate, subjected to a mandatory disciplinary
council, and presumably excommunicated for a “particularly grievous” sin
apparently comparable to rape or murder.

Jesus said, “Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them
not: for of such is the kingdom of God” (Luke 18:16)

The new Church policy, however, says a “child of a parent living in a
same-gender relationship” may not be “baptized, confirmed, ordained, or
recommended for mission service” unless the child “specifically disavows
the practice of same-gender cohabitation in marriage” — disowning their
parents and family. Of whose kingdom is that?

The Church claims its condemnation of gay relationships is about
protecting families. But the Church’s position and especially its new
policy are threatening families around the world — including my own. My
dad, a bishop during Proposition 8 and advocate for gay Mormons for the
past decade, is discouraged and distraught. My mom is sad and upset. My
sister, a full-time missionary in San Diego, now has to represent an
organization that has all but disavowed her brother, in deed if not not
always in word.

My experience growing up in the Church was overwhelmingly positive, and
friends and leaders in my local congregation have been nothing but
loving and supportive. But I cannot in good conscience be a part of a
church where my welcome is conditional on rejecting a core part of my
identity. I do not want to be a part of a church where children are
excluded because of who their parents love. I cannot support a church
that drives teens questioning their sexuality to suicide instead of to
support.

In 2013, Elder Uchtdorf
[said](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2013/10/come-join-with-us?lang=eng&clang=ase)
“...regardless of your circumstances, your personal history, or the
strength of your testimony, there is room for you in this Church.” Not
anymore, apparently.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does not have to be this
kind of church. As long as it is, though, I do not want my name on its
membership rolls. I am hereby resigning my membership, effective
immediately. Please remove the following entry from Church records:

Please confirm when my name has been removed.

More importantly, though, please fix this.
