When I became an Eagle Scout, I had not yet told anyone that I was gay. If I had, I would not have been allowed to receive the award, despite a decade of involvement with scouting, countless hours with dozens of volunteers installing a garden at my elementary school, and more than a hundred nights camping in the California wilderness.

Becoming an Eagle Scout was one of my proudest achievements as a teenager. My parents were thrilled as I was presented with the award in the Mormon chapel where my dad, the bishop of our local congregation and a former scoutmaster, had received his. As I thanked my peers and leaders for their support, I spoke from the same pulpit where a few years earlier, my dad had read a [letter](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mormonnewsroom.org%2Farticle%2Fcalifornia-and-same-sex-marriage&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEnFQW0u32b-zpEztWglkIECylSEA) announcing the Mormon Church's decision to intervene in the battle over Proposition 8, which amended California's constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. That fight entangled California, the Mormon Church, and the Boy Scouts of America in an intense cultural debate that has continued to play out in my own life and around the country.

Since 2008, the country has moved rapidly towards fully embracing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, the shift has been slower, but there has still been progress. Earlier this year, for example, the church [backed](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2015%2F03%2F12%2Fus%2Fpolitics%2Futah-passes-antidiscrimination-bill-backed-by-mormon-leaders.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNE6QyB48hInFWJHFnY6Q4wif7Nfsg) a Utah law banning housing and employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and last month it made an unprecedented [contribution](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.utahpridecenter.org%2Fnews%2Fitem%2F332-lds-church-makes-contribution-to-utah-pride-center&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG-KewPaxVG182AIfCTU1U9erptoA) to the Utah Pride Center.

The Boy Scouts of America has also become a more accepting place. After heated internal discussion, the organization changed its policy to allow openly gay scouts in 2013. Yesterday, it [ended](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2015%2F07%2F28%2Fus%2Fboy-scouts-end-nationwide-ban-on-gay-leaders.html%3Fhp%26action%3Dclick%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3Dsecond-column-region%26region%3Dtop-news%26WT.nav%3Dtop-news&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFa6xwPWZq1CuL1hXHVjnjuT8DUzw) its controversial ban on gay leaders and employees -- although in order to maintain the support of the many religious institutions that sponsor Boy Scout troops, individual units will still be allowed to discriminate.

Despite this compromise, the Mormon Church said that it is "deeply troubled" by the latest change, and is now considering abandoning scouting after a century of support.

That would be a sad mistake. If the church pulls support for scouting, half a million Mormon Boy Scouts -- thousands of whom are probably gay -- will miss out on the friendship, confidence, leadership, mentoring, and fun that scouting can foster.

A Mormon exodus would also cripple the Boy Scouts of America as an institution. The church, which sponsors one in six Boy Scout troops, is by far the largest chartering organization, and if it leaves, Boy Scout troops, councils, and camps around the country will struggle to maintain the funding and membership they need to survive, especially if other religious institutions follow the Mormon Church's lead.

A spokesman for the church [said](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mormonnewsroom.org%2Farticle%2Fchurch-re-evaluating-scouting-program&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHMCq86vCs3hOg92P6gBbxNgpjvqw) that "the admission of openly gay leaders is inconsistent with the doctrines of the church and what have traditionally been the values of the Boy Scouts of America." But the church's official [stance](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmormonsandgays.org%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHD__cDkUCt08xEigOuZmSvAG9w0Q) on what it still calls "same-sex attraction" is that being gay is neither a sin nor a choice, and that gay members who follow church teachings can hold the priesthood, attend temples, and serve in church callings.

The church's unwillingness to allow otherwise-worthy gay men to serve in church callings as Boy Scout leaders -- and its threat to leave the organization for simply allowing other troops to do so -- reveals a deep-seated homophobia within Mormon leadership. Gay men are allowed to serve in other church roles, but they apparently cannot be trusted as leaders and role models for boys, even though the church requires male leaders at its camps for girls and allows women to lead Cub Scouts.

The Boy Scouts of America has finally recognized that it cannot teach young men leadership if it tells some of its members they are unfit to be leaders. If the Mormon Church does not learn the same lesson, it will fracture an important institution that has produced leaders like Neil Armstrong, Bill Gates, and Michael Bloomberg, and given millions of others a moral compass with which to navigate life.

The Scout Oath and Scout Law, which all new Boy Scouts are required to memorize, stress values like bravery, kindness, honesty, faith and duty. The personal integrity I was taught as a Boy Scout helped me decide to come out as gay to friends and family. And gay men who remain committed members of a conservative religion like Mormonism certainly exhibit faith and bravery. There is no reason they should not be allowed to serve as scout leaders.

In an essay for my Eagle Scout application, I wrote about my desire to stay involved with the organization to ensure that other boys had the same opportunities for personal growth that scouting gave me. I am still committed to scouting, and the Mormon Church should be too.
