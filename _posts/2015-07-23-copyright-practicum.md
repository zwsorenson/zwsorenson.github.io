intro: >
    During winter quarter of 2015, I participated in a policy practicum at
    Stanford Law School that sought to improve the copyright process for
    creators and users of digital images. Below is the memo submitted to our
    client, the U.S. Copyright Office, at the end of the practicum, and our
    final report is attached. I wrote the chapter of the final report that
    discusses technical feasibility, and also contributed to other portions.

_The Law and Policy Lab at Stanford Law School is composed of students who are committed to improving public policy in a variety of fields. As Stanford Law students enrolled in the Copyright Policy Lab Practicum, we have spent the 2015 Winter and Spring Quarters under the supervision of Professor Paul Goldstein and Lecturer Luciana Herman conducting policy research on the issues facing photographers in registering their works with the United States Copyright Office, licensing those works for use, and enforcing their rights. We have developed possible options for improving the registration, licensing, and enforcement processes, and we have developed a proof of concept licensing website for photographers and consumers. This research and analysis informs our response to the Copyright Office’s Notice of Inquiry, and is included in an accompanying report, “Low-Cost Licensing of Photographs in the Digital Age: Options and a Proof of Concept.” Our goal is to provide an informed and objective perspective to the Copyright Office as it considers improvements to its current procedures concerning certain visual works._

### 1. What are the most significant challenges related to monetizing and/or licensing photographs, graphic artworks, and/or illustrations?

Ownership information for many photographs uploaded to the Internet is often separated from the work, or is fragmented, or otherwise unavailable. Copyright registration is of limited help – photographers face special barriers to registration because of the sheer volume of the works they produce, and have few incentives to record ownership transfers. Even for registered
photographs and illustrations, metadata and security mechanisms are often missing or, if present, are relatively easy to strip out, making many photographs instantaneously orphan works. Moreover, even if a work is registered and ownership transfers are duly recorded, there is often no ready mechanism for potential users to connect a work they encounter on the Internet with the corresponding copyright registration. Without ownership information, mutually beneficial licensing of photographs cannot occur. Potential buyers or licensees cannot contact the owner for the privilege to use the work and therefore must risk an infringement lawsuit or simply walk away. Moreover, many low-value users may be unfamiliar with licensing laws and procedures, and so will use images without appreciating the infringement risk. These barriers to licensing undermine one of copyright’s central goals – to encourage production of creative works by granting authors a bundle of exclusive rights from which they can profit.


### 2. What are the most significant enforcement challenges for photographers, graphic artists, and/or illustrators?

Digital technologies have vastly expanded the proliferation of images that have no clearly linked ownership rights. Social media sites have a standard practice of stripping out metadata, making rights to images difficult to track. Easy access to these images entices copying by consumers who may not fully understand the liability they incur when they fail to secure rights from an owner or author. Consumers’ perception that limited enforcement against such uses is rare contributes to a norm of not pursuing ownership information.

We studied the community of independent bloggers who typically believe that attribution to the creator or owner of an image is all that is legally required for use. Many bloggers complain that they encounter problems in finding and obtaining authors’ permission to use copyrighted works. They say that they often lack access to the original image owner, and many find that commercially available products that can help track ownership rights are too costly for their limited budgets. A system that allows for quick and seamless connection between image owners and users would be a powerful tool for bloggers, as well as help secure rights and enforcement mechanisms for photographers and graphic artists.

### 3. What are the most significant registration challenges for photographers, graphic artists, and/or illustrators?

The most significant challenge is the lack of a low-friction, low-cost, integrated, automated registration and licensing platform. Associated with the absence of such a platform are a series of related issues, which we have framed in terms of options that may help lower barriers to registration and licensing.

As the Copyright Office aligns its own its own practices and initiatives to support an automated licensing system, it may resolve the challenges that photographers, graphic artists, and illustrators face, by:

- Developing multiple API’s: (1) for access to copyright information and (2) for registration itself.
- Contracting with third-party companies to help process applications.
- Improving the process for registering bundles of photographic works and illustrations.
- Working with social media websites to encourage them to preserve embedded
metadata and license information.
- Soliciting design solutions for an online licensing system through a Notice of Inquiry
and subsequent public roundtable.
- Conducting a market survey and publicizing a subsequent research report that
highlights areas where transaction costs and other barriers to negotiation are the
highest, with the goal of helping to spur private entities to develop a licensing solution.
- Promoting a license search tool, raising awareness among photographers and disseminating information to the public. Such a seal of approval would help any license
search tool gain legitimacy and support.
- Working with image search providers, such as Google Images, to embed a license search
tool.
- Proposing and implementing congressional legislation to spur private licensing
solutions.

These options have varying feasibility and may intertwine and overlap according to the role
that the Copyright Office pursues in facilitating online licensing

### 4. What are the most significant challenges or frustrations for those who wish to make legal use of photographs, graphic art works, and/or illustrations?

Current digital licensing solutions are often tailored to the needs of high-value users, such as commercial publishers, and print and broadcast media, and typically neglect low-value, “long- tail” users, such as small businesses, website and mobile application developers, graphic designers, bloggers, and community organizations. For long-tail users, the limited licensing options and high transaction costs of existing solutions act as barriers to lawful, licensed uses of photographs or other images. Bloggers, for example, are a vibrant portion of Internet communities, yet many encounter problems in finding and obtaining authors’ permission to use copyrighted works. Bloggers complain that they often lack access to the original image owner, and many independent bloggers find that commercially available products are too costly for their limited budgets. A system that allows for quick and seamless connection between image owners and users would be a powerful tool for bloggers.

### 5. What other issues or challenges should the Office be aware of regarding photographs, graphic artworks, and/or illustrations under the Copyright Act?
