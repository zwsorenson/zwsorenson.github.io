Well, I made a blog for some reason. Actually I made a website and the blog was enabled by default so I kept it.

Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not a very frequent written communicator. When I lived in Panama for a summer as a volunteer with [Amigos](http://www.amigoslink.org) (pictured), I sent one letter home during the entire summer — to my parents' great dismay (not pictured). So there's a solid chance I may not post here again.

But if I do end up with something interesting to share and some time to write it up — or more realistically, if I'm supposed to be writing a paper for school and want to procrastinate — maybe I will. You never know who might be interested! Actually I do know. Hi Mom, hi Grandma, thanks for reading.
