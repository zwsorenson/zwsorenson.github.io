On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit unanimously
ruled in [Wagner v.
FEC](http://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/75398759A3FE855D85257E7B00527FA0/$file/13-5162-1561227.pdf)
that a 75-year-old ban on political contributions by federal contractors
is constitutional. The decision comes at a time of renewed interest in
executive action to require that government contractors disclose their
political activity.

The [statute](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30119) upheld
by the court prohibits government contractors from directly or
indirectly contributing to any federal political candidate, committee or
party (though, they are still allowed to make independent political
expenditures or contribute to a PAC). The court found two compelling
justifications for barring such contributions: preventing *quid pro quo*
corruption or its appearance, and ensuring that contracting decisions
are made based on merit and not political allegiance.

Although federal law currently prevents contractors from making
political contributions during the negotiation or execution of a
contract, it leaves open an important loophole by not addressing
political activity before negotiations start. A [draft executive
order](http://www.scribd.com/doc/53440033/Executive-Order-Disclosure-of-Political-Spending-by-Government-Contractors)
first circulated four years ago sought to rectify this gap — it would
have required any individual or corporation submitting a bid for a
federal contract to disclose all political contributions made in the
preceding two years — but it was abandoned before the 2012 election
cycle.

Last week, lawmakers in the House and Senate separately sent [two
letters](http://eshoo.house.gov/issues/justice/bicameral-call-for-greater-transparency-in-political-spending/)
calling on the president to revive this abandoned draft and once again
move to require full disclosure of all political activity by
contractors. According to the House lawmakers: “With public funds come
public responsibilities, and any company receiving federal tax dollars
should be required by executive order to fully disclose their political
spending.”

While it is still possible that the Supreme Court could decide to hear
*Wagner v. FEC* and potentially reverse Monday’s ruling, the fact that
the appeals court issued its decision unanimously and *en banc* —
meaning it came from all of the court’s judges, not just a panel — makes
further appeal unlikely and means that the constitutional case for
limiting the political activity of government contractors is strong.
Hopefully, this strengthened legal foundation will bolster renewed
efforts to require contractor disclosure through executive action.
