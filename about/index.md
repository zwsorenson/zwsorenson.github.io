<p class="lead">Hey, I&rsquo;m Zach!</p>

<img class="img-responsive col-sm-5 pull-right" src="/images/kayak.jpg" alt="Kayaking on the Potomac"/>

I'm a senior at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford</a> studying computer science and public policy. I'm especially interested in cybersecurity and technology policy, and I'm planning on eventually attending law school.

At Stanford, I've spent quarters at <a href="https://siw.stanford.edu">Stanford in Washington</a> and Oxford. I've been involved with <a href="https://sig.stanford.edu">Stanford in Government</a> and the <a href="http://www.stanfordpolitics.com">Stanford Political Journal</a>, and I'm a peer adviser for the <a href="https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu">Public Policy program</a>. This summer, I'll be leading a pre-orientation backpacking trip for incoming freshmen through Stanford Outdoor Education. I am also a tour guide --- drop by the <a href="https://visit.stanford.edu">Visitor Center</a> and get a tour of campus if you're in the area!

Last summer, I worked as a policy intern at the <a href="https://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> in Washington DC, where I wrote blog posts and a daily email newsletter, and researched open government and transparency. I've also worked for the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a>, <a href="http://www.qualtrics.com">Qualtrics</a>, and a couple of <a href="http://www.glazerforsenate.com">California political campaigns</a>.


For the past few years, I've been a training director for the Peninsula Chapter of <a href="http://www.amigosinternational.org">Amigos de las Américas</a>, a really cool youth leadership nonprofit that sends teenagers to live in communities throughout Latin America for a summer. I was an Amigos volunteer in high school --- I spent eight weeks living in working in Las Cabras, Panama.

I was born in Salt Lake City and lived in lots of interesting places as a kid — San Francisco, Durham, NC, and even Samoa — but since kindergarten I grew up on the same sleepy street in Orinda, California.
