I'm currently working on the Hill, and particularly interested in technology policy and national security. I graduated last year from Stanford, where I studied computer science and public policy.

At Stanford, I worked as a research assistant to Condoleezza Rice, working on her bestselling new book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/03/books/review/democracy-stories-long-road-to-freedom-condoleezza-rice.html"><i>Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom</i></a>. I spent quarters at <a href="https://siw.stanford.edu">Stanford in Washington</a> and Oxford, where I studied at the Cyber Security Centre. Outside of class, I have served as a leader in <a href="https://sig.stanford.edu">Stanford in Government</a> and the <a href="http://www.stanfordpolitics.com">Stanford Political Journal</a>, and volunteered as a peer adviser for the <a href="https://publicpolicy.stanford.edu">Public Policy program</a>. I have also led pre-orientation backpacking trips for incoming freshmen through Stanford Outdoor Education, and been a tour guide for prospective students.

Between academic years, I worked as a policy intern at the <a href="https://www.sunlightfoundation.com">Sunlight Foundation</a> in Washington DC, where I wrote blog posts and an email newsletter, and researched open government and transparency. Before that, I interned at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> in the Office of Digital Strategy, at <a href="http://www.qualtrics.com">Qualtrics</a>, and on several California political campaigns.

Outside of school, I worked as the training director for the Peninsula Chapter of <a href="http://www.amigosinternational.org">Amigos de las Américas</a>, a youth leadership nonprofit that sends teenagers to live in communities throughout Latin America for a summer. I was an Amigos volunteer in high school --- I spent eight weeks living in working in Las Cabras, Panama.

I was born in Salt Lake City and lived in lots of interesting places as a kid — San Francisco, Durham, NC, and even Samoa — but since kindergarten I grew up on the same sleepy street in the East Bay.
